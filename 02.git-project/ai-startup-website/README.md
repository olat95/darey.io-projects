## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account with access to the repository
- Basic familiarity with the command line

---

## User Credentials Setup

Before making any commits, configure your Git user credentials to ensure your contributions are properly attributed.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Repository Cloning

Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
mkdir git-project
cd git-project
git clone https://github.com/MMuyideen/ai-startup-website.git
cd ai-startup-website
```

---

## Initial Commit

After making your first changes (e.g., editing `index.html`), stage and commit them:

```bash
git status
git add index.html
git status
git commit -m "This is my first commit"
git push origin main
```

---

## Branching and Feature Development

Always create a new branch for each feature or bugfix. This keeps the main branch stable and makes collaboration easier.

```bash
git branch                # List all branches
git checkout -b update-navigation  # Create and switch to a new branch
git add index.html
git commit -m "Update navigation bar"
git push origin update-navigation
```

---

## Feature Updates

To work on a new feature, switch to the main branch, pull the latest changes, and create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b add-contact-info
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add contact information"
git push origin add-contact-info
```

## Viewing Branches on GitHub

You can view all branches and their statuses directly on the GitHub repository page.

---

## Creating Pull Requests

After pushing your feature branch, open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub to propose your changes for review and merging.

![Create PR](./images/07.create-PR.png)

---

## Pulling Changes

To keep your branch up to date with the latest changes from `main` or another branch:

```bash
git checkout your-feature-branch
git pull origin main
```

![git pull](./images/08.git-pull.png)

---

## Merging Branches

Once your PR is approved, merge your feature branch into `main` (or the target branch) via GitHub or the command line.

---

## Pull Requests from Other Branches

You can also create pull requests from one feature branch to another, facilitating code review and integration.

## Best Practices

- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages.
- Always work on a separate branch for each feature or fix.
- Pull the latest changes before starting new work.
- Use Pull Requests for all merges to ensure code review.
- Keep your branches up to date with `main` to avoid conflicts.
