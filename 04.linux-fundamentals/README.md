# Linux Fundamentals

## Creating and connecting to AWS EC2 Instance (Linux Server)

#### In this project, I will be creating a linux server, ssh into it, and execute basic Linux commands on the Linux server

### The tools used for this project include:

- AWS account
- Terminal
- GitHub

## Sign in to AWS

Navigate to AWS console and signin to your account

## Create EC2 Instance

In the conole search bar, find Elastic Cloud Compute `EC2`

## Launch EC2 Instance

Click Launch instance from the top right of the page

Fill in the required details to create Ec2 instance

- name: `Linux-Server`
- Amazon Machine Image (AMI): `Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (HVM)`
- Instance type: `t3.micro` (free tier eligible)
- Create a ne key pair and name it.
- Download the PEM key
- Leave network settings as Default
- Storage: `15gb gp3`
- Click Launch instance by the right side of the page

## Connect to the server

Connect to the Server following the steps below (Mac Os)

- Open Terminal
- run `cd Downloads` (where the PEM key was downloaded)
- run `chmod 400 "key.pem"` to grant the correct permission to the file
- run the command `ssh -i "<keyname>.pem" <username>@<ec2 DNS name>` || `ssh -i "key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-18-222-112-112.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com`

## Update Package List

run `sudo apt update`

![Apt Update](./images/08.apt-update.png)

## Install `tree` Application

run `sudo apt install tree`

![Install Tree Application](./images/09.install-tree.png)

## Run tree commands

syntax: `tree <directory>`

run `tree ~/Downloads`

![tree Commands](./images/10.tree-commands.png)

## Updating Applications

run `sudo apt upgrade` to update installled packages

![Update Applications](./images/11.update-app.png)

## Uninstall Tree Application

run `sudo apt remove tree` to update installled packages
