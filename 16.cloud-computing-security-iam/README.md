# Introduction to Cloud Computing - Security & Identity Management (IAM)

This mini project is designed to guide you through the intricacies of Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically focusing on Identity and Access Management (IAM).

In this project, we will be working with a hypothetical fintech startup named Zappy e-Bank. This fictitious company represents a typical startup venturing into the financial technology sector, aiming to leverage the cloud's power to innovate, scale, and deliver financial services. The scenario is set up to provide a realistic backdrop that will help you understand the application of AWS IAM in managing cloud resources securely and efficiently.

**The Importance of IAM for Zappy e-Bank**

For Zappy e-Bank, like any company dealing with financial services, security and compliance are paramount. The company must ensure that its data, including sensitive customer information, is securely managed and that access to resources is tightly controlled. AWS IAM plays a critical role in achieving these security objectives by allowing the company to define who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

IAM will enable Zappy e-Bank to:

- Create and manage AWS users and groups, to control access to AWS services and resources securely.

- Use IAM roles and policies to set more granular permissions for AWS services and external users or services that need to access Zappy e-Bank' AWS resources.

- Implement strong access controls, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), to enhance security.

This project will walk you through setting up IAM for Zappy e-Bank, creating a secure environment that reflects real-world usage and challenges. Through this hands-on experience, we will learn the fundamentals of IAM, how to manage access to AWS resources, and best practices for securing your cloud environment.

**Project Goals and Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this project, we will have:

1. Gained a solid understanding of AWS IAM, including users, groups, roles, and policies.
2. Learned how to apply IAM concepts to secure a fintech startup's cloud infrastructure.
3. Developed practical skills in using the AWS Management Console to manage IAM.
4. Understood the significance of secure access management and its impact on compliance and data security in the fintech industry.

**Project Setup**

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console: Use your administrator account to log in.
2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard: Here, you'll manage users, groups, roles, and policies.

## Excercises:

### Creating IAM Users

An IAM user is a unique identity within an AWS account that represents a person or service, granting specific permissions to access and interact with AWS resources under controlled and customizable security policies.

Imagine that you have a big, secure building (AWS account) that you own and control. When you first get the keys to this building, you're given a master key (root user) that can open every door, access every floor, and make changes to the building's structure itself.

This master key is powerful, allowing you to do anything from adding new rooms (services) to changing the locks (security settings). However, because this key can do so much, it's also very risky to use it for daily tasks-like if you lost it, someone could do anything they want with your building.

Now, imagine you have specific tasks that need to be done in the building, like cleaning, maintenance, or security checks. You wouldn't give out your master key to every person who needs to do those jobs. Instead, you create specific keys (IAM users) that can only open certain doors or access certain floors. These keys are less powerful but much safer to use for everyday tasks. They ensure that the people holding them can only access the parts of the building they need to do their jobs and nothing more.

Let's set up IAM users for a backend developer, _John_, and a data analyst, _Mary_, by first determining their specific access needs.

As a backend developer, _John_ requires access to servers (EC2) to run his code, necessitating an IAM user with policies granting EC2 access.

As a data analyst, Mary needs access to data storage (AWS S3 service), so her IAM user should have policies enabling S3 access.

Considering Zappy e-Bank's plan to expand its team with 10 more developers and 5 additional data analysts in the coming months, it's inefficient to individually create similar policies for each new member. A more streamlined approach involves:

1. Crafting a single policy tailored to each role's access requirements.
2. Associating this policy with a group specifically designed for that role.
3. Adding all engineers or analysts to their respective groups, simplifying the management of permissions and ensuring consistent access across the team.

### Create policy for the Development team

1. In the IAM console, click on policies

![iam policies](./images/01.iam-policy.png)

2. Click on create policy

![Create policies](./images/02.create-policy.png)

3. In the select a service section, search for ec2

![ec2 policies](./images/03.ec2-policy.png)

4. For simplicity sake, select the "All EC2 actions" checkbox

5. Also, make sure to select "All" in the Resources section

![Policy action Resources](./images/04.policy-action.png)

6. Click Next

7. Provide the name developers and description for the policy.

![policy name](./images/04.name-policy.png)

8. Click on Create Policy

> Notice that after creating the policy, if you search for `developer` in the search box, you will notice that a number of policies are returned. This highlights the presence of both AWS managed and customer managed policies. AWS managed policies are predefined by AWS and provide permissions for many common use cases, allowing for quick and broad access management across AWS services without the need for custom policy creation like we just did. In contrast, customer managed policies are created and fully controlled by you, allowing for more tailored, specific access controls that can be finely tuned to your organization's requirements.

![create policy](./images/05.create-policy.png)

### Create policy for the Data Analyst team

Repeat the process above for the Data Analysts team, but instead of EC2, search for S3. Also name the policy `analyst` instead of developers. You can give it any description of your choice.

![Analyst policy](./images/06.analyst-policy.png)

---

### Create Group for the Development team

1. In the IAM console navigation, select User group and in the top right click Create group

![iam group](./images/07.iam-groups.png)

2. Provide an a name for the group

![Name group](./images/08.name-group.png)

3. Attach the developer policy we created earlier to the group. This will allow any user in the Development-Team group to have access to EC2 instances alone

![Attach policy](./images/09.attach-policy.png)

4. You have successfully created a group and attached a permission policy for any user added to the group to have access to the EC2 instance only. Recall that users in this group will be backend developers only.

![create group](./images/10.create-group.png)

---

### Create Group for the Data Analysts team

Repeat the process above for the Data Analysts team.

- The Group name should be Analyst-Team
- Instead of attaching developers policy, attach analyst policy.

Recall that you only allowed S3 access for this policy. So any user in this group will have access to S3 Service. In our case, our users will be the data analysts.

![analyst Group](./images/11.analyst-group.png)

---

### Creating IAM User for John

Let's recall that John is a backend developer, therefore he need to be added as a user to the Development-Team group

1. Navigate to the IAM dashboard, select "Users" and then click "Create user".

![iam user](./images/12.iam-user.png)

2. Review the highlights in the screenshot
   - Provide the name of the user. In this case "John"
   - Ensure that the user can access the AWS Management Console. If this is not selected, the user will not be able to login from the web browser.

![name user](./images/13.name-user.png)

3. Permissions: Add the John to the development team aroup.

![add group](./images/14.add-group.png)

4. Click on Create user

![create user](./images/15.create-user.png)

5. Download the login credentials for John

![Get  Cred](./images/16.get-cred.png)

---

### Creating IAM User for Mary

Repeat the same step for Mary. But recall that Mary is a Data analyst, which means she need to be added as a user to the Analyst-Team group

![mary](./images/17.user-mary.png)

### Testing and Validation

#### Testing John's Access

- Login as John: Use the credentials provided to John to log into the AWS Management Console. This simulates John's user experience and ensures he has the correct access.
  ![John-Login](./images/18.john-login.png)

- Access EC2 Dashboard: Navigate to the EC2 dashboard within the AWS Management Console. John should be able to view, launch, and manage EC2 instances as his role requires access to servers for deploying and managing backend applications.

- Perform EC2 Actions: Attempt to create a new EC2 instance or modify an existing one to confirm that John has the necessary permissions. If John can successfully perform these actions, it indicates his IAM user has been correctly set up with the appropriate policies for a backend developer.

![Stop instance](./images/19.stop-instance.png)

#### Testing Mary's Access

- Login as Mary: Use the credentials provided to Mary to log into the AWS Management Console. This ensures that Mary's user experience is as expected and that she has the correct access.

- Access S3 Dashboard: Navigate to the S3 dashboard within the AWS Management Console. Mary should be able to view, create, and manage S3 buckets as her role requires access to data storage for analyzing and managing data.

- Perform S3 Actions: Try to create a new S3 bucket or upload data to an existing bucket to verify that Mary has the necessary permissions. Successful execution of these tasks will confirm that Mary's IAM user has been properly set up with the appropriate policies for a data analyst.

#### Validating Group Policies

For both users, ensure that their access is confined to their role-specific resources (EC2 for John and S3 for Mary) and that they cannot access other AWS services beyond what their group policies permit. This validation ensures adherence to the principle of least privilege, enhancing security by limiting access to only what is necessary for each user's role.

In the image below, we tried creating S3 bucket with the usr john but we get permission denied

![Validate](./images/20.validate-perm.png)

### Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Now that you have created a new users. Let's create Multi-Factor Authentication for John. But before we to that, what is MFA ?

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is a security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your AWS account and resources. With MFA enabled, users are required to provide two or more forms of authentication before they can access AWS resources.

John, the backend developer, logs into the AWS Management Console to access EC2 instances for deploying and testing his code. However, to further secure his access, Zappy e-Bank requires John to use MFA in addition to his regular username and password.

When John attempts to log in, after providing his username and password, AWS prompts him to enter a one-time code generated by an MFA device.

#### Setting Up MFA for John

1. CLick on User and then click on john. It is assumed we already created a user account for john

![User John](./images/21.user-john.png)

2. Click on enable MFA as shown in the image below

![enable mfa](./images/22.enable-mfa.png)

3. Enter a device name for john MFA and select authenticator app

![name mfa](./images/23.mfa-name.png)

> Note: You should install authenticator app like Google authenticator or microsoft authenticator on your mobile device if you don't have it installed.

4. Click on Next

5. Open your Google authenticator or microsoft authenticator application on your mobile device to scan the QR Code, then you can fill in the 2 consecutive codes as shown in the image below

![Add auth app](./images/24.add-auth.png)

6. By completing step 1-5, MFA will be enabled for john

![MFA enabled](./images/25.mfa-enabled.png)

#### Setting Up MFA for Mary

Repeat the same step for Mary
